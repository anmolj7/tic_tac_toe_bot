# tic_tac_toe_ai
A Tic Tac Toe Bot! A dynamic script, that looks into N number of moves ahead, and saves them in a separate file to save time for future computing. I initially wrote the script for a 3×3 tic tac toe, but then, later modified it to work on a NxN tic tac toe. A problem that occurred was the huge computing times for N >= 4, where the player had to wait for more than 20 seconds per move to play against the computer, which was a bit annoying, so solve the problem, I came up with a “hack” where I converted each board position into a simple number. The whole concept was based on the property of prime numbers. Each position was given a prime number, for X, and for 0. Converting a board to a number, was way faster, than computing the board again. After evaluating the board for a certain depth, the script converted the board into a number, and stored into a .pkl file for future use. The project may need some further tweaks, but as of now, it works perfectly fine, and if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.
